Thus, wishful thinking will be to turn my app into a small ecommerce site were users can come and see and comment 
on items for sale purchase with credit card and order purchase and have it deliver to the address of choice and if local 
it can be deliver directly with a small fee charge.

Things i will keep into account will be to add something like a shopping were i can add items and prices. I will be able to select and post items for sale.
Although you might see the option to delete user probably you wont be able because the has a syntax command line were willl not allow you to do that unless
it can be change in the back end side of things.
